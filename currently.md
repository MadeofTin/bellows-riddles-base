Just a place for me to keep track of what I am currently doing, so you can be aware what direction I am heading.

Right now I am trying to figure out if we did do a javascript app what would be the aspect ratio and resolution we would need to have for our master Riddle, Level, and World files. Then we could make them once and the script out resolutions for everything else.

- [ ] How small can I make the top UI
- [ ] How small can I make the riddle selector
- [ ] How small can I make the Riddle Answer UI

I want to base the UI to work for the iPhone 6 optimized. The smaller models will work, but just be a little smaller. I don't think we will get many more phones smaller than the iPhone 6 these days.

- [ ] Decide aspect ratio
  - [ ] World asset
  - [ ] Level asset
  - [ ] Riddle asset

- [ ] Deside max resolution

Once we know the aspect ratio of the images we can just them be designed to work for iPhone 6 Resolution, but be created hidef enough for the ipad. From these master files you can script something that builds on for all of the resloutions we would need to support for the different phone and tablet sizes.

* iPhone 4s (debating about this one being worth it. What are your thoughts?)
* iphone 5
* iPhone 6
* IPhone 6 Plus
* iPad Mini
* iPad Air

- [ ] Write asset Creation standards doc.
