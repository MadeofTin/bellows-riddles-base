*** Some of these will probably be hard or impossible to write riddles for. This is just a brainstorming list of possible ideas ***

## Descriptions

#### ABC

There are 26 Riddles. One for each letter in the alphabet. There isn't a word bank. You just know that the first one starts with "A". You could have the levels progress by having it get more and more difficult somehow. Doesn't seem fun just to have one level in the series.

#### Scholar Mode

Use words like lexicon, conflagration, omnibus, and other words that are not typically used by the normal person. This would have a level progression similar to basic mode, but the extra challenge is you would need to know what each of these words mean.

#### So Many Ways to Kill

There are many unnecessarily fancy words for killing someone or something. I think it could be fun to have a list based off of these. Patricide, Mariticide, defenestrate, etc... I could make a word bank or not. There is a limit to the number of these words already so maybe I would just make them look them up. If that was to hard then I could give them a bank. http://phrontistery.info/kill.html

#### Rhyming Zone

The word would be used in the riddle itself, but left as a ____. So from context you would know what it rhymes with.

#### Phobias

Each Riddle would be to a phobia. http://phrontistery.info/phobias.html and http://phobialist.com/

#### Slang

Used from a bank of slang words probably from the U.S.. Would I dare use http://www.urbandictionary.com

#### Internet Speak

Could be combined with slang. But this would use internetisms like IMHO, LOL, brb, and all those things people use on imgr these days.

#### Scientifically study.

There are a lot of good words for studying different things. http://phrontistery.info/sciences.html
