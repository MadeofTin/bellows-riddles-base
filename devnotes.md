# Notes
First I am really grateful for you taking a look at this for me. What I don't want to have happen is you spend a few days helping me get set up and then get have me keep pinging you for help when you don't have time.

I have been trying to think of a way to make it easy for me to edit without you needing to go in and edit things. I thought of two ways that might work, but if you have one let me know. We could make an easy django app and just use the admin interface to add Riddles and change settings. Or, We could just use Github. The settings files could be in json and the riddles and the riddles groups so the app could just pull changes when it notices there is an update to the git repo. Do you think this could work? Even if I write thousands of riddles it still wouldn't be that big of a json file.

Let me set up a sample of what the settings and riddles could be. I also don't know how painful this would be for you on your end. My goal is just to help minimise your time spend into the program.

There are also a few things you could do on your end to make it a lot easier for me to manage the riddles on my end. A few abstractions of things (that might not be the right word). I'll write more about it later.
