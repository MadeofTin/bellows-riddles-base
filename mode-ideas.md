ABC

There are 26 Riddles. One for each letter in the alphabet. There isn't a word bank. You just know that the first one starts with "A".
Scholar Mode

Use words like lexicon, conflaguration, omnibus, and other words that are not typically used by the normal person. This would have a level progression similar to basic mode, but the extra challenge is you would need to know what each of these words mean
So Many Ways to Kill

There are many uncessarly fancy words for killing someone or something. I think it could be fun to have a list based off of these. Patricide, Mariticide, defenistrate, etc... I could make a word bank or not. There is a limit to the number of these words already so maybe I would just make them look them up. If that was to hard then I could give them a bank. http://phrontistery.info/kill.html
Rymezone

The word would be used in the riddle itself, but left as a ____. So from context you would know what it rhymes with.
Phobias

So many great phobias out there to choose from. http://phobialist.com/ http://phrontistery.info/phobias.html
Slang

Used from a bank of slang words probably from the U.S.. Would I dare use http://www.urbandictionary.com ?
Internet Speak

Could be combined with slang. But this would use internetism like IMHO, LOL, brb, and all those things people use on imgr these days.
Science, the study of

There are a lot of good words for studying different things. http://phrontistery.info/sciences.html
