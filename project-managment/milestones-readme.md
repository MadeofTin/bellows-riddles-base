# Milestones

I want to publish as soon as there is something that is viable to use because I want my release to be focused around answering specific questions. So to fit more in line with that mental process I think I will do Milestones differently.

## Key Terminology


####Version numbers

Version numbers are a goal to reach a milestone that answers certain questions about the app.
 
Example 
```
 v1
 v1.134
```

In this case `v1` is release goal milestone. The number `134` is the number of related issues that need to be closed before we can be done with v1. So we are essentially counting down to the release instead of up. Every issue that comes up adds to this number and every time we close one it goes down. Makes it felxible to as many issues as we want without losing site of the goal, and seeing how close we are.

Don't worry i'll keep up with the version numbering. You just worry about closing issues related to the milestone.
