### This might be fun

I think it would be cool if you could purchase an upgrade that lets Google translate say the riddles. We could default to me reading them. I have the technology and equipment to record from the music side of my life.

All you need to do is do this.

If people like it we could build other readers in for a price. We would need to purchase licenses so it would make sense to be an in app purchase. Maybe even someday we could get someone famous to read them like Morgan Freeman! Woh... that would be awesome. Can you imagine Morgan Freemen reading these riddles to you.... so epic....

Maybe we could put a lets see if we could get Morgan Freeman to read our Riddles Button and accept the charge but not process it untill he actually agrees. So People are not only saying they want it but that they would buy it. If there was enough money promised I bet we could get someone to notice. Or Maybe Leim Neison. He seems cool. Or we could have a voting match but with dollars! Could be fun if the app was popular enough.
