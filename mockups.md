# Mockups

I really want to focus on athestics. Minimal UI. Eventually I would love for it to have a [Godus](https://www.google.com.tw/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F232810%2F&ei=IzE7VPrZF5eD8gWSnILYCQ&usg=AFQjCNFBSD1wmZGiBe4PLBOTC1B26JdlRQ) feel. Where there is an actual world that does stuff and each riddle level you solve improves your people.
But.... that is a lot more work than we need to at the moment. So, I Think doing strait images and then doing just animations mp4 would have a similar effect. Right now I don't have many assets but really want to find someone who could make something awesome feeling. Like win an art award awesome feeling.

It seems like you are sort of javascript implementing this so I found [this][http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13224037/mapping-areas-on-an-html5-video] that would explain how to do mapping over a video. (You probably already know a better way to do this though.. haha) The underlying video would not need to be interacted with so, the concern he brings would not be a big deal. But it means we could abstract out the world design as I get a better artist to do it and even move around where the levels are physically without needing to do more code. ***Do you think that would be worth the effort?***

You think it work so we could start with just an image and then move to an animated movie playing in the background. I'll put more about what kind of style I am looking for in the [branding.md] (bellows-riddles-base/branding.md)

## Mockup Documentations

#### Default Mode View ####
If you download the app it actually changes as you move up the screen. Don't know how hard it is to do that (maybe paralax?) but it probably isn't worth it the first time since I haven't found a good animator and that would be largely up to him. But the idea of the path of levels I like with pretty stuff around it that would change (loading a different image) as you complelete levels. Mine would be more spread out because there would be significantly less levels. In this example getting to level 41 with 50 riddles per level would mean ***2,050 riddles*** or ***82 days*** of riddle writing at 25 riddles a day...
