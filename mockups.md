# Mockups

I really want to focus on athestics. Minimal UI. Eventually I would love for it to have a [Godus](https://www.google.com.tw/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F232810%2F&ei=IzE7VPrZF5eD8gWSnILYCQ&usg=AFQjCNFBSD1wmZGiBe4PLBOTC1B26JdlRQ)
But.... that is a lot more work than we need to. So I Think doing strait images and then doing just animations. Right now I don't have many assets but really want to find someone who could make something awesome feeling. Like win an art award awesome feeling.

It seems like you are sort of javascript implementation so I found [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13224037/mapping-areas-on-an-html5-video) that would explain how to do mapping over a video. You think it work so we could start with just an image and then move to an animated movie playing in the background. I'll put more about what kind of style I am looking for in the [branding.md] (bellows-riddles-base/branding.md)
