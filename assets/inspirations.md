#### Difficulty Symbols

When I was making a the keyboard I wanted an easy way to see which difficulty you were on, and an easy way to switch between difficulties. So I needed some kind of image. Ran into the Halo Image difficulty [Halo Image difficulty ](/assets/inspirations/difficulty-images.jpg). Which are obviously more complex than we would want. I am thinking more a smiley face that gets more and more boss till the master difficulty is a Gandalf Mode. Or something. But it would work just like you use the "Globe Language Selector" in the normal iOS keyboard. But, you are only allowed to go down in difficulty on a level. If you have purchased the difficulty reducer. Great way to make it easy to see and then purchase the in app upgrade. When they would be looking for it.
